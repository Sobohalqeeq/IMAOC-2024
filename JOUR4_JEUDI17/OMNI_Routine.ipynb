    "## Historical CMEs and Solar Flares: Big Events\n",
    "1. **The Carrington Event (1859)**: This was the most powerful geomagnetic storm on record. A massive CME hit Earth, causing spectacular auroras visible as far south as the Caribbean and knocking out telegraph systems worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Quebec Blackout (1989)**: A powerful CME caused a geomagnetic storm that knocked out Quebec’s electrical grid for 9 hours. Auroras were visible as far south as Texas and Florida.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The Halloween Storms (2003)**: A series of CMEs and solar flares caused severe geomagnetic storms in late October and early November. Satellites were damaged, GPS systems were disrupted, and auroras were visible even at mid-latitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## CMEs and Solar Flares: Harmful Effects on Earth\n",
    "1. **Solar Flares and Communication Disruptions**: Intense solar flares can cause radio blackouts by disrupting the ionosphere. This can severely affect GPS signals, aviation communication, and military operations.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **CME-Induced Power Grid Failures**: CMEs can induce strong geomagnetic currents in Earth's magnetic field. These can overload transformers and cause widespread blackouts, like the 1989 Quebec Blackout.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Satellite Damage**: Both solar flares and CMEs can affect satellites by causing radiation damage to their electronics and altering their orbits due to increased atmospheric drag from the heating of Earth's upper atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Astronaut Safety**: During solar storms, astronauts in space can be exposed to dangerous levels of radiation, which is why space agencies closely monitor solar activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **The Starlink Satellite Loss (2022)**: In February 2022, a relatively small CME caused geomagnetic storms that led to the failure of 40 Starlink satellites shortly after their launch. The increased drag from the heated atmosphere due to the storm caused the satellites to re-enter and burn up in Earth's atmosphere.\n",
